# Face-Emotion-Detection

This repository contains a Streamlit application designed to predict facial emotions from both uploaded images and pictures taken directly with the camera. Users can either upload an existing image or use their device's camera to capture a new one, and the application will analyze the facial features to determine the displayed emotion.

## Usage, Deployment & Streamlit User Interface

The application is deployed and accessible at Railway: [Face Emotion Detection App](https://face-emotion-detection-production.up.railway.app/)
